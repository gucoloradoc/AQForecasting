In this project we are going to forecast the air quality in Mexico City. The plan is to carry out this forecasting using machine learning, firs with a "plain model" (Feng, 2015). But first just some visualizations and a exploratory analysis.
Description of the data is available in aire.cdmx.gov.mx.
